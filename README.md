- 👋 Hi, I’m Tim Cornillaud (@corneo)
- 👀 I’m interested in microprocessors, mostly.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about microprocessors
- 💞️ I’m not really looking to collaborate on anything just yet.  I'm pretty much at the kindergarten level so I suspect I couldn't be of much use.
I am hoping to change that.  It is so early in my journey that I can't even guage yet how long it might take to know enough to be reasonably productive.
- 📫 I can be reached at TimCornillaud@gmail.com
